BUGS
in mc, beeBreeding sometimes fails to move a drone to alveary and trashes many drones
  - might have been caused by running out of one drone type, exception catching added
during new multi trait breeding, algorithm takes much longer and fails with some expensive combinations
can also run out of b type drones much faster than expected
  - semi automate combination testing?


Testing
((species catalogue (for generating default bees of some different species)))

Features
upgrade lua algorithm for multi stat optimization
translate stat numbers to nice strings
mutate program with fake components
finalize mutate algorithm to discover new species
